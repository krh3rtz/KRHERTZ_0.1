# KRHERTZ_0.1
A simple text mono-cipher crypter coded in C. 

Inspired by the c√®sar crypting system, Krhertz  intends to be used as a tool of plain text
obfuscation. The normal usage of this crypter is by adding text to a "hello.txt" file, which will    
then be crypted to obtain a "obf.txt" file. To decrypt the text, you only need the already mentioned 
"obf.txt" file and choose the "Decrypt" option in the menu. This will generate another file (decrypted.txt) containing
the plain text which was originally written in the "hello.txt" file.

FUNCTIONS:

	Crypt:   	Uses an mono-cipher algorithm to obfuscate the "hello.txt" file contents.

	Decrypt: 	Generates a "decrypted.txt" file with the original plain text from the "hello.txt" file.

	Instructions:	Opens this info-file.
 
	Iterations:	Enter a number or iterations to crypt/decrypt a obf.txt (currently in developement).

FILES BREVIARY:

	hello.txt:	File tha contains the original text to encrypt.

	obf.txt:	TXT containing the crypted text.

	decrypted.txt:	File containing the uncrypted plain text.
 
 Disclaimer: This crypter is not ready to be used as a security tool, yet we are working to do so.
	     Use at your own risk.
